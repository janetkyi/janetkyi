My name is Janet Kyi and I'm a junior majoring in biology with a minor in public health on the premed track 
Here's some fun facts about me !
- I can play 6 instruments- guess which ones
- I'm a diehard baseball fan (LGM) 
- I can not cook for the life of me (I once burned an egg- do what you want with that information)
- I was born and raised in New York City! 



### My story

Well there's a lot more to me than those simple facts so if you want to know more just hmu we can have a nice conversation about how the Mets will once again fail next season
