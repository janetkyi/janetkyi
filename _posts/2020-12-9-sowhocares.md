This is a post to talk about why we care about COVID, from a public health and biology standpoint. Many people might find this boring so if you don't like science skip this you'll be bored out of mind 

**So who cares?**

## NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO 

Here's a useless table (disclosure none of this is factual info):

| How many people care | Science Majors | Nonscience |
| :------ |:--- | :--- |
| Boomers | 40 | 0 |
| Gen X | 50 | 10 |
| Millenials | 79.5  | 20.5 |
| Gen Z | 99.9 | .1 |


What life was like before COVID-19

Life with COVID-19!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
