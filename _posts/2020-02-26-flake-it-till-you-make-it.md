It's been one year since China announced a mysterious pneumonia-like illness that was spreading around the country. Soon enough it reached Seattle. Then it reached New York City and then the rest of the United States. We heard stories of violin players on the balconies in Italy, the re-emergence of animals in rivers and oceans, and the burden of the frontline workers all around the world. Our news channels are filled with coronavirus news- good or bad, political or not. This pandemic has changed people's lives dramatically... some for the better, some for the worse.
So before I go into a deep scientific analysis of why this is important well this is why. No one wants to live through another pandemic. But if we don't figure out what exactly caused this one, it won't be long before the world gets shut down again with more angry civilians demanding for "life to go back to normal"
If we ever want life to go back to normal, or even somewhat normal, we have to prevent this from happening again. And how do we do that? Figure out how it all started in the first place.
